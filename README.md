#Inclusionary Housing in Reno: Nursing Facilities and College Housing

# Executive Summary

Our audience consists of the Reno City Council, Reno Housing Authority, Reno residents, particularly seniors and college students, Local Non-profit organizations, Developers/Contractors, and Mayor Hillary Shieve. Our audience cares about the fair representation of residents in the election process of Reno City Council Members, which requires them to take action to build inclusionary housing for college students and nursing facilities throughout Reno. The benefits of acting include oversight in the development of district maps, housing for the largest demographic groups, and equitable representation throughout the city. If no action is taken, the legislative body would determine districts without regard to communities of interest, potential gerrymandering, minority group voter suppression, discredit to the government institution, and perpetuate the housing crisis. Building strategic inclusionary housing for the two largest demographic groups in Reno will equalize voter representation throughout the city.
